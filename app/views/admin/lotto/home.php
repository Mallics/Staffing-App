My thoughts were that this page would be a control panel thing... <br>
<a href = "<?= URL::to('admin/schedule/user/all');?>">user list - what classes they are in</a><br>
<a href = "<?= URL::to('admin/schedule/user-assignment');?>">user skill form</a><br>
<a href = "<?= URL::to('admin/schedule/course/all');?>">course list</a><br>
